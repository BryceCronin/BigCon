# Work in Progress
This project is still a work in progress. If you like, you can download the STL files below to construct a Big-Con yourself now. However, a lot of changes will be made after the conclusion and judging of the hackathon, so you may want to hold off for a few weeks :)

# Assembly Instructions
Detailed assembly instructions are coming soon. Fortunately, the assembly process is intuitive and you should be able to figure it out - most components can only go in one place.
1. Connect the Middle Body and Bottom Body pieces together.
2. Connect the Joystick and Joystick Mount pieces together, then sandwich it between the Top Body and Joystick Mount pieces and screw into place.
3. Tension the Joystick using 4 extension sprigns.
4. Insert the 4 buttons into their holes on the Top Body piece and add 4 compression springs into the corresponding holes on the buttons and on the ABXY Mount piece and screw into place.
5. Attach the 4 ABXY Connector pieces to the buttons, manual drilling is required (this will be fixed in the next update)
6. The L and R buttons can be attached using the same method as step 4.
7. Attach the lid onto on body. You're done!
